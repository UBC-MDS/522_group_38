# Code of Conduct

## Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity

We plan on creating a welcoming environment through welcoming all ideas from different backgrounds and being respectful of differing viewpoints. We also aim to foster an environment where any sort of discrimination, whether on the basis of sex, race, gender, income, ableism, and many other factors is prohibited.

## Our Standards

Examples of expected behaviour:

* Complete all work by the agreed upon deadlines, and up to the standard outlined in our team contract
* Attend all meetings unless noted otherwise
* Encouraging participation amongst group members 
* Communicate in advance and effectively if an issue arises, such as not being able to finish the work in the allotted time period

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using insulting language or putting others down
* Using offensive language such as swear words
* Public and or private harassment
* Not finishing assigned work in the allocated time 
* Any conduct that would be considered unprofessional in a professional environment


## Consequences for Unacceptable Behaviour

The team will note and discuss any occurrences of unacceptable behaviour, and a detailed description of each occurrence will be noted in our Slack group chat.  If repeated occurrences occur, then the course teaching team will be notified and they will be asked to impose any appropriate sanctions on the offending member. 

## Procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour

If any occurrences of unacceptable behaviour occur, the issue must be mentioned to the rest of the team through our Slack chat or emailed to the project manager at moizsafd@student.ubc.ca. A group meeting will then be held outlining the offense. If repeated offenses occur, the matter will be escalated to the course instructor and teaching team.
